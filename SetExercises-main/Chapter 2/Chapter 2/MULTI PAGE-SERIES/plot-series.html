    <p> A Game of Thrones can be broken down into three stories:
        <br /> <br /> 
        (1) The longest part of this book tells how the noble Stark family deals with conspiracy and court politics in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, with particular emphasis on Eddard Stark, the father and leader of the noble family.
        
        (2) A second story follows the exiled princess Daenerys, one of the last descendants from the previous royal family, as she grows up on another continent.
        
        (3) A third story follows Jon Snow, the illegitimate son of Eddard Stark, as he grows up in the north of Westeros. He is in the special military order called the Night's Watch, which is dedicated to protecting the civilized Seven Kingdoms from the dangers beyond the Wall.</p>
